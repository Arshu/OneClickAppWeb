## App Web Runtime Readme

This repository contains the MIT Licensed App Web Runtime, which is a reference implementation used by the One Click Mobile Packer to Pack Html Web Apps to create Android/IOS Mobile Native Apps

It is part of toolkit for developing Portable Apps. Portable Apps are Apps (UI, Data, File and Interaction) which can be redeployed from one run time environment to another run time environment

AppWeb Runtimes can be built using Cross Platform AppWeb Components using Xamarin Tools
