## AppWeb Component Use Case

<ol>
	<li>
		Pack any Html5 Web App (portable AppWebs) into domain specific AppWeb Runtime to easily create Mobile Hybrid Native Apps.   
	</li>  	  
	<li>
		Build and publish your own domain specific AppWeb Runtime using Xamarin Tools for others to pack their Html5 web apps.
	</li>	  
	<li>
		Rapid prototype using Html5 UI and then upgrade incrementally from Html5 App Page(s) to Native App Screen(s)
	</li>
</ol>


## AppWeb Component (WebView + MicroService)

AppWeb Component is a cross platform embedded Web View with a micro web server which enables the implementation of JSON Micro services to access native os functionality.

AppWeb Component can be used to create domain specific AppWeb Runtime using Xamarin tools which can be used to package Html5 Web apps into native android/ios apps.

AppWeb Component enables easy mixing of WebView with Native Views to build appropriate functionality depending upon the requirement.

AppWeb Component enables building of JSON Micro services which can access native os functionality and provide a common abstraction across both Android/IOS apps.

AppWeb Component also bundles MIT Licensed Open Source Components like PetaPoco etc to provide a common abstraction to access SQLite

AppWeb Component is part of toolkit for developing Portable Apps. Portable Apps are Apps (UI, Data, File and Interaction) which can be redeployed from one run time environment to another run time environment.

## App Web Runtime (JSON Micro Services)

AppWeb Runtimes are embedded JSON micro services which provide common abstraction of useful functionality for Html5 based application.

Html5 web apps can be packaged as a zip file in a AppWeb Runtime and deployed as a Native Android/IOS app.

The AppWeb runtimes will on first run will extract the zip file and load the index.html file available in the root of the zip file.

The Html5 appwebs will interact with the embedded JSON micro services using AJAX to orchestrate useful functionality.

## One Click Mobile (Pack and CodeSign in Windows/Mac)

Packing of Html5 web apps into Pre Generated AppWeb Runtimes can also be done using the OneClickMobile Packer. 

The OneClickMobile Packer can also be used to codesign IOS IPA by packing Html5 WebApps to IOS Native apps without a MAC

## Portable Apps (AppWebs - Html5 in AppWeb Runtime)

Portable Apps are AppWebs which run on a Common AppWeb API Runtime which are developed to run on multiple OS Platforms. The Multi-Platform AppWeb API Runtimes provide a common architecture and domain abstraction which enables apps to be migrated from one environment to another environment where a compatible app runtime providing similar domain abstraction is available.

	Portable Apps – App API Runtimes – OS Platform Runtime – OS Platform

Easiest way to create portable apps are to create apps using web based technology running on a web based app runtime which provides JSON API Micro Service abstraction as well as a File and Database abstraction API’s. By standardizing on Publisher-Subscriber code demarcation in an App, it is easy to build highly flexible and reusable ability in the code base. 

Xamarin Tools provide the additional facility to mix native UI where the Web based UI is not appropriate for best user experience.
